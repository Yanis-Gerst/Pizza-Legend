# Pizza-Legend

It's a game similar to Pok√©mon but with pizzas. There are four areas in which you will have to face your first boss. In this game, we have five pizzas and four different types (meat, cheese, mushroom, vegetable). Pizza Legend was designed to be rather difficult, and once the pizza skills are unlocked, you'll need to be a good strategist to beat the enemies.

# Tech

This game was programmed in vanilla Javascript using Object-Oriented Programming and vanilla CSS. This project allowed me to understand the importance of a clean code and helped me to gain a good understanding of how JavaScript works.

# En dev

I am currently developing the home screen of the game as well as the tutorial for the controls with its visuals.
